# U-Learn — Universal Multimodal Learning & Accessibility Assistant
Powered by Gemini 3 Pro (Google DeepMind Hackathon 2025)

## ⭐ Overview
U-Learn is a multimodal AI system that converts text, images, diagrams, gestures, sign language, and YouTube videos into fully accessible educational content.  
It is designed to support learners with visual or speech impairments while improving learning for everyone.

This project was built for the **Vibe Code with Gemini 3 Pro Hackathon**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Millions of students—especially visually impaired or speech-impaired learners—cannot access educational content in diagrams, handwritten notes, gestures, or spoken videos.  
Teachers also cannot auto-generate quizzes, flashcards, or simplified explanations from learning materials.

U-Learn solves this by using multimodal AI to **summarize, interpret, explain, quiz, and translate gestures** in real time.

## 🚀 Features
